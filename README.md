# CuckooWebClient.github.io
A hacked Minecraft client in the browser that can connect to real Minecraft servers!
Note: Sometimes, mobs will not be displayed. That's because i tried making a texture test for mobs too and it failed and i didn't delete the code, because when i tried to, mobs were completely destroyed.
