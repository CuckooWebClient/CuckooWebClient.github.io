# CuckooWebClient.github.io
A hacked Minecraft client in the browser that can connect to real Minecraft servers!
Note: In versions higher than 1.10.2, mobs will not be displayed. That's because i tried making a texture test for mobs too and it failed and i didn't delete the code, because when i tried to, mobs were completely destroyed. However, I still think it will be even funnier with all mobs invisible!
